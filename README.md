# Weedspotter
Prototype of web application

This is a weed spotter web application developed for the Queensland Herbarium.

The Weed Spotter App is developed to combat weed problems and protect the Australian ecosystem.

The design of the application focuses on providing the required functionalities as per requested by the client. The client has specifically requested changes to be made after seeing the second draft of the prototype. The client requested to have a Queensland Herbarium logo indicated on the homepage and adjust the color scheme into brown and green to fit the logo. The client also suggested the user guide for each page to be more specific since she believes that these guides should serve as a how-to guide for the user. These changes made makes the application itself more user friendly and serves the purpose of speeding up the weed spotting process for the weed spotters.

GPS coordinate function

The main purpose of the application is to allow users to collect all the information about the plant or weed spotted within the application. Therefore, the application will ask the user for the permission to use the user’s current mobile location. This would ensure that the plant or weed’s location is recorded by the application. Moreover, by learning the user’s location can make Queensland Herbarium to identify the weed spotted more efficient.

Camera function

The client has specifically requested to have a camera function integrated into the application. This is required since the major aim of the application is to ask weed spotters to take a photo of the weed or plant they have spotted. The client has made the statement of the user needs to at least take a photo of the entire plant and the leaves of the plant. Then the user would have the option to take a photo of the plant’s flowers and fruits if spotted.

Plant information

The most important part of the application is the plant information page. Since this section asks the weed spotters to enter information of the plant or weed spotted. The information the user is required to fill in are the following:

● The plant is either a grass, herb, shrub, tree or other ● The plant is cultivated or growing wild ● Contact information.
